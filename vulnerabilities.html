					<h2>What is it?</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>
							<li>Usage of third-party libraries, commercial and open-source, has increased in applications over time.</li>
							<li>Even the most utilised and trusted components can contain vulnerabilities that compromise their security.</li>
							<li>Using these libraries introduces their security flaws into the application using them (obviously).</li>
							<!-- <li>Introducing these libraries improperly can lead to the introduction of the security flaws to all applications which use them.</li> -->
							<!-- <li>Projects including multiple dependancies can potentially be introducing large numbers of security vulnerabilities!</li> -->
						</p>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Impact</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>
							<li>Having multiple dependancies on libaries with security flaws can lead to a compounded impact on the application.</li>
							<li>It was estimated that 26% of all downloads from the 'central' repository contained a vulnerability.</li>
							<li>More information on it's prevalence can be found <a href="http://www.aspectsecurity.com/research-presentations/the-unfortunate-reality-of-insecure-libraries" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
						</p>
					</ul>
					<!-- <p>The range of potential components mean that the impact of introduced vulnerabilities can vary depending on the application using them.</p> -->
					<!-- <p>More information on it's prevalence can be found <a href="http://www.aspectsecurity.com/research-presentations/the-unfortunate-reality-of-insecure-libraries" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> -->
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Exploits</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>
							<li>3rd party libraries are often open source, making the finding security flaws in them easier than a hidden application.</li>
							<li>They are also used by multiple applications making the flaw exploitable in multiple attacks.</li>
						</p>
					</ul>
					<!-- <p>There are plenty of reasons to target 3rd party libraries for security flaws rather than directly targeting the main application.</p>
					<p>Components are often open source and therefore the potential exploiter has access to the code to determine the vulnerabilities.</p>
					<p>The potential for any flaw to extend across multiple applications also makes it an appealing target, as the discovery and exploitation of any  vulnerability grants a large range of potential targets.</p> -->
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Updates and fixes</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>
							<li>Currently when a security flaw in a 3rd party library is discovered it is patched relatively quickly.</li>
							<li>The flaw is documented, but no reporting service exists for all people using the libary to update their dependancies.</li>
							<li>Projects can therefore be using out of date insecure libraries.</li>
						</p>
					</ul>
					<!-- <p>Usually after security vulnerabilities are discovered it does not take long for developers to update and fix the issue.</p>
					<p>However a lot of the time there is no clear mechanic for informing users of any updates for security purposes.</p>
					<p>This means it is quite common for applications to be using out of date dependancies with old security vulnerabilities still in place!</p>
					<p>This is a worse scenario as the older issues tend to be better known and therefore more people know how to exploit them.</p>
					-->
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Undiscovered vulnerabilities</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>
							<li>Libaries that have vulunerabilities in them that have yet to be discovered are tricky.</li>
							<li>Fixing these relies on someone reporting them or QA finding it, or an attack happens that brings the flaw to their attention.</li>
						</p>
					</ul>
					<!-- <p>In many cases the vulnerabilities found in component libraries are not yet discovered.</p>
					<p>As a result many new breaches are not due to new updates to the library but already existed in the code.</p> -->

					<h2>Solution!</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>
							<li>There are very few ways to prevent utilisation of vulnerable third party software; short of never using any third party dependancies at all.</li>
							<li>Following the four simple steps outlined below allows at least an extra degree of control and security.</li>
							<li>Additionally GDS guidelines on third party libraries can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/dependency-management.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Inventory</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>
							<li>Look up known faults and vulnerabilities for the version you use as well as how out of date it is.</li>
							<li>Remember to check the dependancies of your dependancies.</li>
						</p>
					</ul>
					<!-- <p>The first step is to take stock of your current project dependancies and versions.</p>
					<p>This involves looking up known faults and vulnerabilities for the version used as well as how out of date it is.</p>
					<p>This also involves checking the dependancies of the dependancies which are often overlooked.</p> -->
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Analyze</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>
							<li>Always check the status of your build when you update to a newer version of a library.</li>
							<li>Check reviews, process, licenses and other aspects of the library project.</li>
						</p>
					</ul>
					<!-- <p>When acquiring or updating a library make sure to always check for yourself the status of the build.</p>
					<p>If examining code directly is infeasible then check reviews, process, licenses and other aspects of the library project.</p>
					<p>This early step can help prevent a lot of hassle compared to dealing with problems further down the line.</p> -->
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Control</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>
							<li>Set standards such as only having authorised libraries and dependancies in projects.</li>
							<li>Use developer discretion!</li>
						</p>
					</ul>
					<!-- <p>A good process to have in place is a method by which only authorised libraries and versions can be used in projects.</p>
					<p>A developer can request to have a library added to the list when a suitable level of analysis is complete.</p>
					<p>The method to determine what ends up on this list should not be overly difficult as it will encourage users to bypass the restriction.</p> -->
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Monitor</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>
							<li>Keep a constant track of the known vunerabilities in a library and try to use the most up to date.</li>
							<li>Having to alter your code to take into account of an update is no excuse not to do so.</li>
						</p>
					</ul>
					<!-- <p>Where analysis has shown it to be safe, all dependancies should be kept up to date.</p>
					<p>Having to alter your code to take into account of an update is no excuse not to do so and is an accepted fact of using third party libraries.</p>
					<p>As there are typically no automated methods to be informed of updates to libraries, it is the developer's job to keep up to date with the library's development status and news.</p> -->
				</section>
				<section id="flaw-tools">
					<h2>Tools</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>
							<li>There are some automated tools that can keep you informed of the latest news and versions of dependancies.</li>
							<li>While these are useful and can be a time-saver, they are no substitute for performing the checks yourself.</li>
						</p>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Tools (cont.)</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>
							<li>SBT can be used to keep dependancies up to date by using 'latest-integration' in place of the version number.</li>
							<li>OWASP's Dependency Check is a tool that examines dependancies for any publically reported vulnerabilities for java libraries.</li>
							<li>Sonatype's CLM is an automatic tool designed to manage dependancies throughout the development lifecycle.</li>
							<li>"Bobby" is an in house tool created to perform a similar function as Dependancy Check for scala libraries.</li>

					<h2>Examples</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>
							<li>What will follow are two famous examples of third party libraries introducing vulnerabilities.</li>
							<li>There are typically no reports on more recent cases until the problem has been fixed to avoid more people attempting to exploit it.</li>
						</p>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Spring MVC (2013)</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>
							<li>Using an HTML request the intruder could directly inject code and execute it server side, potentially even taking control of the server.</li>
							<li>This was a previously fixed issue that re-emerged due to the discovery of additional issues relating to the flaw.</li>
							<li>At the time an estimated 1.3 million instances of the flawed component had been downloaded.</li>
						</p>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Apache CXF (2012)</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>
							<li>The vulnerability occurred whenever a user submitted a request without providing any identity token.</li>
							<li>This allowed any web service to be executed with full permission without authentication.</li>
							<li>This was also the second emergence of the issue with a prior occurance of a similar fault in 2010.</li>
							<li>An estimated 4.2 million downloads of the framework occurred within a 12 month period in 2013 (before the problem was patched).</li>
